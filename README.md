# CajunLyrics-Web

## Description and Purpose

CajunLyrics.com is a phenomenal site with an extensive collection of lyrics for Cajun songs. As it stands now, you can submit lyrics, which require approval, and you can suggest edits in the comments for a lyric. While this is a completely reasonable way to maintain lyrics, I've been finding myself wanting to make quick edits and additions. This project will allow for this functionality, and provide a way to view the original and the edited/added lyrics in a seamless way. The lyrics are retrievable from an API that CajunLyrics.com offers. The backend will be a REST API that merges the read and write behavior, and stores the edited lyrics in MongoDB. The frontend will be React/Vite. As of yet, I've not decided if this will be hosted. At the very least, it will run locally and have access to a local data store.

## Other Information

If you're like me, and have become a rabid fan of Cajun music, this site is a *sine qua non* for learning the song lyrics. At times, you'll notice discrepancies in what's transcribed and what you hear, so I humbly submit this as a way to address that gap.
